1) Fix RAS timestamp.

2) Make sqlite code thread safe: it currently hangs if two CPUs
   try to record data there at the same time.

3) Add a "supervisor" proccess that will avoid the daemon to stop.

4) Handle signals.

5) Better handle error conditions to be sure that events won't be
   lost.

6) add a tool to handle the sqlite records, in order to detect if
   the errors are just random noise or if they mean that memory is
   damaged.

7) add a tool to inspect the EDAC data.

8) add support for PCIe AER trace records.

9) add support for mce trace records.
