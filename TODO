2) Make sqlite code thread safe: it currently hangs if two CPUs
   try to record data there at the same time.

4) Handle signals.

5) Better handle error conditions to be sure that events won't be
   lost.

6) add a tool to handle the sqlite records, in order to detect if
   the errors are just random noise or if they mean that memory is
   damaged.

8) test support for PCIe AER trace records.

9) add support for mce trace records.
