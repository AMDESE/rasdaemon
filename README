RAS Daemon
==========

Those tools provide a way to get Platform Reliability, Availability
and Serviceability (RAS) reports made via the Kernel tracing events.

QUICK USAGE
===========

sqlite3 and autoconf needs to be installed. On Fedora, this is done
by installing the following packages:
	make
	gcc
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool
	tar
	sqlite-devel	(if sqlite3 will be used)

To install then on Fedora, run:
	yum install -y make gcc autoconf automake libtool tar

Or, if sqlite3 database will be used to store data:
	yum install -y make gcc autoconf automake libtool tar sqlite-devel

Run (without sqlite):
	$ autoreconf -vfi && ./configure
	$ make

or, if sql3database will be used:
	$ autoreconf -vfi && ./configure --enable-sqlite3
	$ make

As root:
	# make install

The daemon generally requires root permission, in order to read the
needed debugfs trace nodes, with needs to be previously mounted.
The rasdaemon will check at /proc/mounts where the debugfs partition
is mounted and use it while running.

To run the rasdaemon in background, just call it without any parameters:

	# rasdaemon

The output will be available via syslog. Or, to run it in foreground and see
the logs in console, run it as:
	# rasdaemon -f

You may also start it via systemd:
	# systemctl start rasdaemon

The rasdaemon will then output the messages to journald.

A script is provided under /contrib, in order to test the daemon.
While the daemon is running, just run:
	# contrib/edac-fake-inject
