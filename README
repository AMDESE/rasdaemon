RAS Daemon
==========

Those tools provide a way to get Platform Reliability, Availability
and Serviceability (RAS) reports made via the Kernel tracing events.

QUICK USAGE
===========

sqlite3 and autoconf needs to be installed. On Fedora, this is done
by installing the following packages:
	make
	gcc
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool
	tar
	sqlite-devel

To install then on Fedora, run:
	yum install -y make gcc autoconf automake libtool tar sqlite-devel

Run:
	$ autoreconf -vfi && configure
	$ make

As root:
	# make install

The daemon generally requires root permission, in order to read the
needed debugfs trace nodes. Just run it without any parameters to start
capturing the RAS memory errors:

	# rasdaemon
